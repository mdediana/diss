@article{Ghosh2010,
abstract = {Most of today\&rsquo;s enterprise applications use a relational database management system as the underlying data store. This often creates an impedance mismatch between the application layer and the data layer, because most applications use object-oriented or functional languages. Storing data the same way it\&rsquo;s used in the application would simplify the programming model, making it easier to decentralize data processing and, in turn, enable horizontal scaling. Emerging NoSQL data-storage engines support this strategy. Just like the application layer, the data-storage layer can use multiple paradigms and store data in a way that\&rsquo;s semantically closer to the corresponding domain models. This article discusses a strategy for using multiparadigm data storage within a single application. It includes an architecture for keeping multiple data stores in sync by using a messaging system that asynchronously pushes updates between data stores, achieving eventual consistency.},
